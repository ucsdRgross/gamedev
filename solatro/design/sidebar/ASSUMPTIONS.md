# ASSUMPTIONS.md — reversible decisions taken while executing PLAN.md

- `HudContainer`'s children are authored in `hud_container.tscn`, so `HudContainer.new()` yields a
  bare `PanelContainer` with no children. `TestSidebar` instantiates `hud_container.tscn` instead,
  still with no `Main` and no wall in the tree (C1, Q150).
- `Main.enter_game()` hands its wall's own `HudContainer` to `GameView.hud_container` before
  attaching the view, so `_bind_hud_container()` binds to exactly that wall's container. A
  standalone fixture with no `Main` leaves it null and gets a private `HudContainer` as its own
  child instead -- same scene, same accessors, freed with the view like everything else it owns.
- TEST_PLAN 3.4 expected the board's centre to MOVE when `%MultScore`/`%Preview` were deleted. It
  cannot: the inset was `_hud_authored_width() * hud_scale()`, which is `0.25 * 1576` = 394 whatever
  the widest control. Measured pre-deletion centre 733.808; 3.4 asserts it is unchanged (C4, L9).
